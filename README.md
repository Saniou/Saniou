### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a front-end developer with over a year of experience in web application development. During this time, I have learned and used technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as various frameworks and libraries, including ReactJS, NextJS, and NodeJS.

My favorite technologies and tools:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
TypeScript
ReactJS
NextJS
NodeJS
Git
SASS/SCSS
TailwindCSS
PostCSS

I also have experience with many popular libraries such as MUI, DaisyUI, Tremor, and many others.

I have completed courses at Hillel IT-school in Frontend Pro and have completed several projects that I am particularly proud of:

A music app using the Spotify API
A small store with the ability to register and log in
A clone of the Margelo website using different types of animation
You can find more information about me and my projects on my portfolio website.

Now I am actively working on a startup project. It will be an application for Google Chrome - a planner organizer that will help you to be more organized and productive.
